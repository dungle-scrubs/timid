# Timid Roadmap

## Done
- [x] Menu bar app with global hotkey (Ctrl+Option+N)
- [x] Slide-out panel from right edge
- [x] Smooth easing animations (matched in/out)
- [x] Rounded corners on left edge
- [x] Read most recent note from directory
- [x] Edit files in-place with auto-save on change

- [ ] Shadow fix (still has issues)
- [ ] Create new note
- [ ] Delete note
- [ ] File watcher (reload when files change externally)
